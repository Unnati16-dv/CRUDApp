#About this app:
This is a basic Angular Application to start my learning journey of making 2 layered architecture. I have used Angular as Frontend and ASP.Net Core (Payment API) with Entity Framework as backend for processing the get, put, post and delete request from Payment App.
In it, The home page is dividied into 2 parts, 1 is a form which takes some card details like Name of the Card Owner, Card Number, CVV and Expiration date of the card. The second is a list of cards which displays the name of the Card's Owner and Card number.
Each item in the lsit had edit and delete button.
The application sends get, put, post and delete methods to the ASP.Net core backend.
